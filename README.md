# Guide For Beginners 🧑‍🦯
**Firstly**, you must create an account (powered by Clerk) to create a page! It is recommended to put your username or the name you go by for the page!

**Secondly**, you must edit your links display with your actual links- the default links are NOT your social media links! We do not know your social media accounts!

**Thirdly**, you can adjust the colors of the page however you want. You can make it yellow in background, red in text, even another font if you like (try to stick to our font unless you know what you're doing!) and change the texts!

**Fourthly** (is that even a word?), you can publish your page to make it public. Then, copy your AIOL link and clean-up your link-filled bios!
